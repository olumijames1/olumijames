		<p>Affiliate marketing (AM) simply means you are recommending useful products to people who need them

And when those people buy based on your recommendation, you get a commission

Now, let’s go back a bit.

I said AM means you are recommending useful products to people who need them

The keywords here are:

RECOMMEND

USEFUL PRODUCTS

PEOPLE WHO NEED THEM

The only type of products available on Expertnaire are digital products

These are products like ebooks, software, online courses

So, let’s say you go to Expertnaire and decide to market a product on how to lose weight
<img class="about-the-ACADEMY" src="skl.jpg">
Basically, what this means based on our previous definition is that

You are to RECOMMEND this useful product (on how to lose weight) to people who need the product (aka people who want to lose weight)

So, what do you do?

Number 1 – You grab your affiliate link for the product on Expertnaire

This is the link that you give to the people who want to buy the product.

When they buy through this link, you get a commission

Each product has its own affiliate link

You can view various products and get their affiliate link under the PRODUCT MARKETPLACE Section

Affiliate links on Expertnaire look like this: https://expertnaire.com/manager/product/6105527475/6636035222

Number 2 – You Should Understand the Product You Want to Recommend

In order to market any product effectively, you have to really know what it is about. This way, you will be able to explain it and answer questions based on it.

To do this, you should study the product itself or the sales message about the product

Use your affiliate link to access the sales message of the product

Number 3 – Find the People Who Need the Product

Since only the people who need a particular product will but it, the next thing you have to do is to FIND people who are interested in the product.


</p>
		<p>This is simple logic.

E.g. People who are slim won’t buy a “lose weight product”

You find these people by searching for them within:

– Whatsapp or Email List

– Your Social media followers

– Other people on social media

– Other people on the internet

Searching for them means running an advert. The advert can be paid or non-paid

E.g. If you send an advert to people on your whatsapp or email list, that can be classified </p>
